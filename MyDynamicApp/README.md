# My Dynamic App

This is a simple React application that dynamically updates the displayed text as the user types into a text box. It demonstrates the use of React's `useState` hook for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Dynamic Text Update**: The text entered in the input box is displayed below it in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive layout.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the input value.
