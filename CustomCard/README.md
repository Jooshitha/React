# CustomCard Project

This is a simple React project that demonstrates the use of reusable components and Tailwind CSS for styling. The project displays two cards side by side with dynamic text passed as props.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: The `Card` component is designed to be reusable with customizable text.
- **Dynamic Props**: Each card displays text passed via props.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Cards are displayed side by side using Flexbox.

## Outcome

Majourly I'm practicing here is the Tailwing for css and using props to modify the properties in React
